This was my 3rd car modeled in Blender. It took me a whole summer to finish but I reached good results. I need to improve even more the reflexions and the shiny parts, but I will make it better the next time.

And here I leave my progression modeling Blender cars... starting with the lambo, was the first one, I improved it in terms of shaping and reflections.

## First one (late 2017):

## Second one (mid 2018):

## Third one (late 2018):
