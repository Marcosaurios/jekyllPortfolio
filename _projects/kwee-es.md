On my last year of Multimedia Engineering Degree we are evaluated with an PBL (_Project Based Learning_), a group of 4 friends and me developed [Kwee](www.kwee.ovh). Kwee it's a web platform for finding your ideal job in the IT world. Let's say you're a brand or a company hiring new people, so you sign up as business user in our platform and you publish a new offer. The candidates would like to join this offer, so they should sing up as a candidate and apply to your offer. If you're a student we also bring to you the possibility for being a practise employee in any company that offers it. 



Our most distinguishing feature it's Kwee Index. It's a score to show how reliable the user is in our platform. This index it's available for every user (business and candidate) and it's built with the opinions you received, your skills, your educations and your behavior in our platform. This score it's useful to see if the user suits the requirements that you are looking for
