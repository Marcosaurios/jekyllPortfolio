On my last year of Multimedia Degree, a groups of 5 friends and me developed Kwee. Kwee it's a web platform for finding your ideal job in the IT world. Say you're a brand or a company hiring new people, so you sign up as business user in our platform and publish a new offer. The candidates who would like to join this offer, should sing up as candidates and apply to your offer. If you're a student we also bring to you the possibility for being a practise employee in any company that offers it.
