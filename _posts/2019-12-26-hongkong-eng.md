Once I had finished the mandatory Project Based Learning in Multimedia Engineering, I thought about the possibility to finish the last two subjects of my degree abroad. Hong Kong CityU University accepted my proposal and I started my last studies there.

Sunday, 25 of August of 2019 at 8pm, was the day and time chosen for landing in Hong Kong. I took the MTR till Sham Shui Po, the neighbourhood where I was going to live during the next 5 months. When the train stopped we tried to find the closest exit to reach my accomodation and suddenly some people black dressed started screaming and running very fast to exit the subway in a hurry. It was the moment when I saw a guy wearing a gas mask when I realised this group of people were protestors coming back from a demonstration. This is Hong Kong, and like special things happens, a random but nice woman helped us to reach the first subway exit, and later she come along with me until we find my accomodation.
