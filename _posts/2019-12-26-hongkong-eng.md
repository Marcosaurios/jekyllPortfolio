Once I had finished the mandatory Project Based Learning in Multimedia Engineering, I thought about the possibility to finish the last two subjects of my degree abroad. Hong Kong CityU University accepted my proposal and I started my last degree studies there.

## Hong Kong

Nothing will be more Hong Kongese in these times than finding a protest on the subway station where we had to stop. We saw black dressed people with gas masks running, screaming and skipping every security check. The situation was strange by itself, but the thing got better when a woman helped us to reach my accomodation safely. This was my first impression of Hong Kong: unexpected chaos but secure. As a foreigner, every Hong Konger tries to help you to be safe and avoid the conflicts, that's so nice by their part. 

I took the first weeks as adaptive time for me, it was my first time living alone and also abroad; I was living in Sham Shui Po, a very local neighbourhood where not everyone can speak english, so it was a bit tricky to have dinner around my accomodation. Luckily I met some local friends able to speak english, like the receptionist -Ken- which ended being a really good friend of mine, and also Derrick and James, two nice guys who were the barmans of the coffee bar in my accomodation. Every day I had the breakfast there and started the day talking about music taste, people, travelling or anything with them.

During the first days, it was a bit strange to be alone in the other part of the world. It made me to think about a lot of things that we have in our daily routine that we don't realise how important they are. Your family, your house, your local food, your friends... But sometimes to keep growing is need to leave your comfort zone and start a leap into the void. In this void I found the friends who were going to go along with me during all this adventure: an italian girl, two spanish boys, a few dutch, some belgiums, one crazy austrian and a big group of germans. And damn, they filled that void with adventures, experiences and a really great time together, meeting them and discovering Hong Kong!

Hong Kong is such a nice *'country'*, full of people of every part of Asia, lets you to meet new friends of any part of the world and explore not only the Hongkongese culture, also a wide range of cultures. I'm saying *'country'* between quotes because right now is an 'Special Administrative Region' (SAR) of China. Even the Hongkongers say they have two different government system for one country, a fact that is a bit contradictory. It's a difficult matter to discuss and to conclude something... 

## Philippines, meet the contrast

The first trip we did was Philippines. We stayed in Manila for 4 days, and maybe it's not the best place to enjoy the beaches and the nice weather, but we discovered that the citizens turn crazy when they see an european just walking there. We took a lot of pictures with people of every age and they were so nice and polite! Manila is the place where probably you can be a bit scared or feeling insecure about the people because how they look like, maybe thinking they are not trustworthy. But really, every Philippino I've met is so nice, simpathic and honest, he won't give you any reason for not trusting him. You will see the contrast of the richest people there and the poorest

## Japan, where tradition and technology mixes in one

Another trip we enjoyed a lot was Japan. We booked the flight 7 hours before the plane took off, so we packed all our clothes very quickly and headed to the airport. The first city we went was Osaka, a beautiful and lovely place, full of neon lights and advertisements in every building. It's impressive, being there feels like being in a film, surrounded by people very different than you, the street markets, the weather (compared with Hong Kong it's way better, less poluted and you can feel a breeze of fresh air); it's an environment you'll need to live it to understand it.

This area of Japan is more traditional than Tokyo, so it will be a bit more tricky to communicate with locals speaking english. Don't hesitate to ask anything to a young japanese, they will be a bit shy at first but will try to help you. You have to understand that you're in a very respectful and traditional place in the world; so don't expect to find people as open and outgoing as spaniards ðŸ˜‰



## South Korea, reaching the most respectful society I've ever met
