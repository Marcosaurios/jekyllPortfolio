Hi! 

Welcome to this web's first post! Before continue, if you don't know who I am it's quite strange that you're reading this, but don't worry because I think a introduction it's needed. I'm Marcos Urios, a guy interested in sports, 3D modelling and web development. I really enjoy discovering new things, so I could define myself as a curious and explorer person.

When I'm not thinking about any work to do (it's quite difficult nowadays), I like to free my mind surfing or kitesurfing with my friends. In those sports you depened of the weather conditions (_unpredictable_) and you need to be ready for any situation you'll find, just for when it comes, be able to face it and overpass it. I like thinking like this because it's kind of how life works, but in the perspective of a game, playing those sports (not at the same level, obviously).

> In this blog you'll find interesting posts about web development, news, videogames or even any other fact about me.

Finally, I would like to dedicate this personal project just lift off to my family, specially to my grandparents. Thanks to everyone for giving to this dune your grain of sand.
